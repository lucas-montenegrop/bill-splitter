# 💸 Bill Splitter App

## 🚀 30-Second Elevator Pitch

A modern bill-splitting web application that makes it effortless for groups to track shared expenses, split costs fairly, and settle balances transparently. Built on the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js), this app eliminates confusion around “who owes what” by providing real-time expense tracking, flexible splitting options, and clear balance summaries—perfect for roommates, trips, and group activities.
